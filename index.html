<h1>Compelling example</h1>
<p>Consider a 16QAM and a rectangular 8QAM constellation. In this document all constellations will be represented with strictly non-negative coordinates so that distance vectors have + and - while coordinate points are always written without the sign. So the constellations in question would look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="16QAM and 8QAM constellations" src="./img_16QAM8QAM.png" /></p>
<p>Both of these constellations exist in 2 spatial dimensions and transmit 4 or 3 bits respectively. If we composed a system where we alternate between using the constellations we might expect to get a net throughput of 7 bits every 4 spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>However, if for every pair of 16QAM and 8QAM points we allow a choice of whether to send the 16QAM first or the 8QAM point first we can extract an 8th bit from this scheme. In this way we can represent the valid codewords in this new hybrid constellation as first picking O (blue) or X (red), then picking any point of that colour on the first graph then picking any point of the same colour on the second graph.</p>
<p><img alt="16,8 QAM hybrid constellation" src="./img_hybrid.png" /></p>
<p>This has the same throughput as the original 16QAM constellation but requires less power to transmit. I will also show that the minimum symbol distance is also still 2 even though it may not seem obvious at first glance.</p>
<p>Imagine we transmit the symbol [1,1,0,4], that is the codeword with x=1,y=1 on the left graph and x=0,y=4 on the right graph. If we experience a noise vector of [+0.7, +0.6, +0.3, +0.1] which has a euclidean distance of about 0.975, we get the black dot as shown on the following graph:</p>
<p><img alt="point shifted by noise, appears closer to a valid point on the left graph but is still closer to the original one" src="./img_noise_example.png" /></p>
<p>Even though on the left graph the point is closer to the point at [2,2], you can only chose that if you also use a blue point on the right graph. the vector from the valid codeword [2,2,5,1] to the green point is [-0.3,-0.4,-0.7, -0.9] which has a length of about 1.245, further than the original point. Any pair of neighbouring codewords will either differ in a single dimension by +-2 and be equal in the other 3 dimensions, or in all 4 dimensions by +-1. </p>
<h2>A more systematic structure</h2>
<p>In the previous example we are selecting between 2 different constellation schemes that have a different number of bits, this produces some issues regarding encoding and as we increase to higher dimensions we may wish to not use the exact same number of both mappings. The core reason the hybrid map worked is that both maps use orthogonal grids where each point is spaced out 2 units in some dimension and then the mappings were offset by a vector of [+1,+1,+1,+1] relative to each other. We can use this property to produce a different mapping where we encode 2 16QAM symbols then based on a 9th bit we possibly offset the whole mapping by [1,1,1,1]. This would produce the following constellation where we interpret the graphs similarly, to choose a codeword first pick whether you want a blue O or a red X, then select any point on the left graph of chosen colour, and any point on the right graph of the chosen colour.</p>
<p><img alt="16 QAM with bias" src="./img_16qambias.png" /></p>
<p>This would transmit 9 bits per 4 dimensions having slightly higher throughput compared to 16QAM on its own but also requires more energy. I won't analyse this structure specifically in depth but this is the first step to expanding to higher dimensions.</p>
<h3>Decoding</h3>
<p>As long as the received vector is within the convex hull of the constellation it is trivial to determine which 'box' (region seperated by grid lines) the received vector is in as it is solely determined by the integer part of the vector coordinates, then we could enumerate all the valid codewords that touch that box which in the 4D case would be a red codeword and a blue codeword and then check which of those viable codewords are closer. Better decoder designs may exist but this is the approach used in my research. When a vector is outside the convex hull of the constellation currently I am brute-force checking all points in the constellation as I haven't analysed more efficient techniques yet. </p>
<h2>extending intuitive example into higher dimensions</h2>
<p>In 4D we essentially had one bias vector that we could optionally add to an existing QAM point to get a new codeword, in 6D we can have 4 bias options to get a second bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>[+0,+0,+0,+0,+0,+0]</li>
<li>[+1,+0,+1,+0,+1,+1]</li>
<li>[+0,+1,+1,+1,+0,+1]</li>
<li>[+1,+1,+0,+1,+1,+0]</li>
</ul>
<p>These are generated using logic explained below and then the elements are shuffled such that all three 2D slices hit each possible value of [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)] so that we can easily visualize them in the same manner as the previous constellation designs:</p>
<p><img alt="thingy" src="./img_shapesin6d.png" /></p>
<p>This could be used as a constellation of its own, effectively transmitting 2 bits every 6 dimensions, but the advantage is that this can be layered on top of existing QAM constellations like the previous example. Where each point in the 6D extension of some QAM constellation is duplicated by each bias vector to generate valid codewords. If we plot the codewords for 16QAM it looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="6d16QAMbias" src="./img_6d16QAMbias.png" /></p>
<p>The way to choose a codeword is the same as before, first pick a colour and then pick a point of that colour from each figure to generate one codeword. This gives us 4+4+4+2=14 bits per 6D (4 bits for each graph + 2 bits from which colour is chosen) You may notice this is looking a lot like 64QAM which suggests our constellation could be described as a block encoding applied to 64 QAM, however because of the geometric structure we can potentially implement better decoding than solely interpreting it as a block encoding to one higher modulation of QAM.</p>
<p>If we use 4QAM as our seed instead of 16QAM we get a smaller constellation which I can use for an example:</p>
<p><img alt="4QAM modulated by tetrahedrons in 6D " src="./img_4qambias6d.png" /></p>
<p>We could interpret this as a 16 QAM constellation with grey mapping so it contains 12 total bits, then using just the bits find a valid codeword that is the least number of bit flips. The mapping of the codewords to 8 bit sequences is not relevent for this analysis.</p>
<p>If our grey mapping maps the vector coordinates to bit sequences: 0-&gt;00, 1-&gt;01, 2-&gt;11, 3-&gt;10, then the all 1s message would correspond to the point (2,2,2,2,2,2) which is a valid codeword (the top right blue point)</p>
<p>Then suppose our noise vector is [0, +0.6, +0.1, +0.6, 0, +0.6] resulting in the purple point in the above figure. Decoding as 16QAM it will be very certain the byte sequence is 1110 1110 1110, this is not a valid codeword but the middle graph's X position (dimension 3) can vary to get 2 other valid codewords that are both green.</p>
<ul>
<li>1110 0110 1110 at coordinate (2,3, 1,3, 2,3)</li>
<li>1110 1010 1110 at coordinate (2,3, 3,3, 2,3)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the block decoder had enough information it could determine the second one is closer because the +0.1 in the 3rd dimension but both of these codewords are further away than the transmitted message:</p>
<p><code>(2, 3  , 3  , 3  , 2, 3) 
 - (2, 2.6, 2.1, 2.6, 2, 2.6)
 = (0, 0.4, 0.9, 0.4, 0, 0.4)
 length is sqrt(3*0.4^2 + 0.9^2) = sqrt(1.29)</code></p>
<p>Where as the length of the noise vector to the original message is sqrt(3*0.6^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(1.09). This is true in general where the closest bitwise distance to a valid codeword may not be the euclidean distance to a valid codeword. The goal of this research is to analyse structures where we can quickly determine a relatively small set of viable codewords to check using euclidean distances.</p>
<h1>modular space and representations.</h1>
<p>** NOTE: I realized I am reinventing the wheel here,*<em> I am just defining linear block codes with distance 4. My system isn't nearly as good as modern codes like Reedâ€“Muller codes, that one ends up with 2^m - m - 1 basis vectors in 2^m dimensions which is better than my about 0.75</em>M in M dimensions. I can likely swap out my code with a modern one to get better results, the interesting part that I really care about is when we add on a second level of modulation later on.</p>
<p>For the rest of the document I wish to move away from the part where the bias vectors are applied to a QAM mapping. To accomplish this we will analyse the bias vectors in modulo 2 space, this is a valid approach since in general we are duplicating each bias vector by 2 units along each dimension in both direction in the general case when we layer it on top of a QAM constellation. I will also start using bit strings to represent the bias vectors as this is closer to the way it will eventually be implemented.</p>
<p>In 4d we have our first viable bias vector of 1111. in 6D we can get the 4 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>000000</li>
<li>111100</li>
<li>110011</li>
<li>001111</li>
</ul>
<p>(if we shuffle around the bits this gives the vectors used in the above example, I wish to lay them out like this moving forward)</p>
<p>the vector 111100 is the same as our original 4d case and if we XOR it with the vector 110011 we get the last vector. This means we can map our 2 bits for biassing to the vectors 111100 and 110011, xor the result and that gives us a valid final bias vector.</p>
<p>In 7D we can add another bias basis vector:</p>
<ul>
<li>1111000</li>
<li>1100110</li>
<li>1010101</li>
</ul>
<p>The only property we wish to preserve is that each basis vector differs from each other basis vector by at least 4 bits, this gives us 8 possible bias vectors which because each of the basis vectors vary by 4 bits from each other are guarenteed to also vary by 4 bits from each other. I know this could be proven but I'm not sure how to write it formally.</p>
<h4>side tangent for geometry</h4>
<p>To have N points all equal distance away from each other we need N-1 dimensions. This corresponds to a pair of points in 1d, a triangle in 2d, a tetrahedron in 3d etc. I'm not sure how to prove it but I know if you have N dimensions you can have the vectors [1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,0], etc. where all coordinates are 0 except one is 1 and with N dimensions you get N points, I feel like you could then build a matrix out of the difference vectors and show it has rank N-1 which implies the shape with that many points could exist in N-1 dimensional space but I'm not sure how to formalize this yet.</p>
<h4>back to the 7d case.</h4>
<p>Since our 3 basis vectors form 8 points in 7D space that are all equal distance from each other, using the logic shown in the side tangent this is the most connectivity we could expect. As we expand further we expect to put 16 points in less than 15 dimensions so moving any further will require not all the points we generate to be densely adjacent.</p>
<p>In 8D we have our 4th basis vector and it shows a repeating pattern into higher dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>111100000...</li>
<li>1100110000...</li>
<li>10101010000...</li>
<li>000011110000...</li>
<li>0000110011000...</li>
<li>00001010101000...</li>
<li>000000001111000...</li>
<li>0000000011001100...</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not have a proof that this is the optimal pattern given the constraint that each must be different by at least 4 elements from each other and we compare them in modulo 2 space but it does work. It also produces the first non densely connected bias vectors as 11110000 and 00001111 are disjoint.</p>
<h2>Higher order modulation.</h2>
<p>When we get up to 16 dimensions we have yet another oppertunity. Similarly to how we could fit a new point in a 4D hypercube, in 16 dimensions the coordinate with all 16 entries of 1/2 will be 2 units away from the origin as well as every possible point that falls on a lattice point from the first order modulation used above. This means we can layer this independently using the exact same construction as a lienar block code with minimum distance of 16 in however many dimensions we have.</p>
<p>So we can imagine a constellation in N dimensions by taking the first N bits and map them to a 4*I generating matrix, that is each element when set to 1 moves in the corresponding dimension 4 units. Then the next set of bits use a linear block code of distance 4 and size N to determine which dimensions to move 2 units in. Then a third layer with size N and distance 16 that moves in 1 unit. This becomes a lattice consistent with 64 QAM and forms an extremely dense lattice. (now that we doubled the lengths so we didn't have to deal with lengths of 1/2 every lattice point is 4 units away instead of 2 as it was previously) this construction still strictly maintains the property that every single codeword is a minimum of 4 units away, equivelent to our original 4QAM constellation but our throughput can achieve comparable rates to 2/3 of 64QAM.</p>
<p>A specific case is that in 128 dimensions using Reedâ€“Muller code, the block length is 2^m so m=7, for the first order modulation r=m-2 such that the minimum distance of 2^(m-r) gives 2^(m-(m-2)) = 2^2 = 4 and for the second order modulation r=m-4 so that the min distance is 2^4=16, and with a 4QAM seed we also get k=2^m=128 since we encode a bit on each dimension. if we calculate the aggregate k values of all three layers we get:</p>
<p>m=7, k=2^m + (sum from a=0 to m-2 of (m choose a)) + (sum from a=0 to m-4 of (m choose a))
k = 312</p>
<p>Compared to 128*3=384 bits that the underlying 64QAM constellation transmits unencoded. this makes our block code have a rate of 13/16 for the 128 dimension case.</p>
<h3>note about vector spacing and notation</h3>
<p>Originally when talking about just the first order modulation where it differed 4 dimensions at a time, I used the 1-dim movements as 2 and the 4-dim movements as 1 so they both have a length of 2. Then I went and changed it so that when we have the 2nd order modulation it instead has the 1-dim movements of 4, 4-dim movements of 2 and 16-dim movements as 1, and the 64 dim movements, 256-dim movements do exist and it'd be inconvinient to have to change how we represent the basis every time but also using fractional numbers is a pain. I logically think of the constellation as existing strictly in the bound [0,2) where the 1-dim movements go 1 of the way, the 4-dim movements go 1/2, the 16-dim movements go 1/4 etc. As you add higher and higher modulations it converges to fill the entire region with every rational number with a power of 2 as the denominator gets hit.  This makes me think vaguely of polar codes and how they recursively define rules but I don't know nearly enough about those to comment on whether this is similar at all. It also extends very naturally to using higher QAM as the seed since the integer part will directly correspond to the underlying single dimensional constellation and the fractional part corresponds to the modulations from my construction.</p>
<h2>reason I think this is useful at all and is worth something.</h2>
<p>To my understanding, modern block codes do not consider the underlying constellation used to transmit them and this seems like a flaw. I know in my information theory course we proved that an optimal constellation and an optimal error encoding scheme jointly optimized cannot possibly give better results than optimizing them independently, and also that any constellation will tend towards gaussian as the dimensionality increases and therefore pretty much any constellation design is roughly equivelent and I feel like this is the logic for why people just kept using QAM. However if block codes don't consider the underlying transmission technique they may map valid codewords that may be far hamming distance but the physical distance of the codewords can be quite close and therefore the error rate for those symbols is worse. With a scheme with 2^200 codewords that maybe only a small fraction have bad structure because they happen to be close isn't a huge issue, but it certainly isn't optimal. I don't need to claim my scheme is any more optimal, I'm sure a real system will need additional block codes applied on top of it to have the redundency desired which runs into the same issue, but having a system that actually achieves the goal that global minimum physical distance between codewords is the minimum of every possible pair of nearest neighbours feels like a very good property for a transmission scheme to have.</p>
<p>Also I'm pretty sure this scheme will work much better in high SNR environments, the length of a gaussian noise vector in N dimensions follows a chi distribution which has the mean shift as the dimensionality increases, with high SNR if the majority of that distribution falls within the minimum neighbour distance the probability of error should go down much faster than other encoding schemes that don't have uniform distances between symbols.</p>
<h3>isometries</h3>
<p>It is also possible that if we can prove isometries of the neighbouring vectors fall into only a few groups i'd significantly simplify the effort required to calculate an exact analytic solution for a strict upper bound on the symbol error rate.</p>
<p>If we have a set of all possible neighbouring vectors (from any given codeword all the nearest neighbours will be found at a subset of that list and every vector in the list is used for at least one point in the constellation) and can prove that one vector is isometric to every other (considering the set of all possible rotations/reflections/ unitary transformations of space that map the set of vectors back to the same set of vectors) then it should prove that the boundary of correct symbol detection - assuming a dense infinite lattice - would be the equivelent of a regular polyhedron in N dimensional space. This would mean the hyperplane bisector of one such vector which defines the boundary that a vector will be decoded as one or the other should have a regular polygon shape uniquely defined by the shared neighbours, if you connect that regular N-1 polyhedra to the original coordinate you get a N dimensional equivelent of a polygonal cone. Taking an integral over the noise vectors for that volume gives the probability of receiving a point within that volume due to a particular noise model, then if we proved that every neighbour is isometric to any other we just multiply this probability by the number of neighbours to obtain the exact probability of correctly decoding the transmitted symbol within an infinite lattice. Since edges of the lattice are more likely to decode the correct symbol when the noise is pointed outside the lattice entirely, this would be a strict lower bound on the probability of correctly decoding the transmitted symbol and therefore gives us a strict upper bound on the probability of symbol error as an analytic solution.</p>
<p>This volume calculation could be done regardless of isometries but unless all vectors are isometric to each other you cannot just multiply by the number of neighbours you'd have to at least do that volume calculation for each class of isometries. Since it is a very regular lattice I wouldn't expect the isometries to be any more classes than the number of layering modulation schemes but this is way beyong what I am capable of actually checking at this point. :P</p>
<h1>Things to further investigate</h1>
<p>the way I am generating lattice points has very similar structure to points in the <a href="https://cohn.mit.edu/kissing-numbers">kissing numbers table</a>  (the downloadable list of points) I know I found <a href="https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v5i1r22/pdf">a paper</a> that uses linear block codes and a very similar construction to my construction where they are just trying to find points around the origin where as I am trying to find a valid lattice, but it might be true that putting their lattice points inside a modulo space gets to the exact same thing, although theirs is slightly different since it has 2 points differing by the highest number.
- look more into that paper's construction and whether it can be generalized to a block code directly for maximum adjacency.
- look into papers that reference that paper that may relate to creating block codes based on the idea of having high packing. It is very possible someone else has done something like this.
- figure out more optimal block codes for specifically 24 dimensions since the exact optimal kissing number is known for that and if I ahve first and second order modulation and with optimal block codes it hits the kissing number I can be damn sure this is on the right track.
- look into lattice codes, get a comparison and try to understand motivation behind them as they may relate to my construction.
- use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griesmer_bound">Griesmer bound</a> to calculate what the optimal transmission would be at any given dimensionality, make a plot.
- figure out whether I could calculate the number of neighbour vectors without actually knowing the vectors, just by knowing the size of the block code. Be useful to compare to the theoretical max of the kissing number.</p>
