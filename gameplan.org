- write code to generate constellation in same manner as 4600 project
- write code to generate noise vectors to symbols directly and do decision device based on closest valid symbol
- each message can contain effectively one symbol for simplicity, generate BER graph

- then extension is to generate a noise figure, apply it to all valid symbols and see which ones create errors
