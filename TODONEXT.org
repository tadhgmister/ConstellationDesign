Talk to Ian, ask about normalization and also how to write journal paper and motivation

HOW TO FINISH MASTERS, is a lot less structured and need help defining a structure

- what is end point, if the thing doesn't work the way I want where do I go from there?

- how to keep self on track / schedule when I have no idea how long specific things will take.
- What kinds of resources for citations/usefulness
- who else I should talk to about requirements
- I have so much trouble reading papers and not sure how much is because it is hard and how much because of ADHD and focus.
- I have a technique to simulate messages for AWGN that works at constant time wrt SNR, is that useful as it's own thing?
- what constitutes a masters? How do I know whether I've gotten there or how close I am? - is there a defense of some kind?

- if still unsure let him know

- interested in building resources, either software libraries or learning tools.

- spending more time academically, in lab, interacting with other people


- alternative noise models
- grasmanian, not knowing channel?
